# Housing Price Prediction - Web Deployment

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a web application for predicting housing prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms. The app uses a pre-trained linear regression model to make predictions.

## Repository Contents
- `Housing.csv`: The dataset used to train the model.
- `model.pkl`: A pre-trained linear regression model saved as a pickle file.
- `app.py`: A Python script that uses Gradio to deploy a web interface for predicting housing prices.
